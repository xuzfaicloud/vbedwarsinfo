      Hey there! It seems like your ad blocker is causing some trouble. No worries, we've got you covered! Here's how you can fix it:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Disable Your Ad Blocker:</strong> Whether it's built into your browser (like Brave or Opera) or an extension, make sure to turn it off.</li>
      <li><strong>Check Your VPN:</strong> If you're using a cheap VPN, it might also trigger the ad blocker detection. Consider using a reputable VPN service or try accessing without a VPN.</li>
      <li><strong>Use 1.1.1.1:</strong> If none of the above options work or if you don't have an ad blocker enabled, try using the **1.1.1.1 DNS resolver.**</li>
    </ol>
